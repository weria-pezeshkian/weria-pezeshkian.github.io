# TS2CG version 2.0

TS2CG converts triangulated surfaces (TS) to coarse-grained membrane models for molecular
simulation.
It also works as a backmapping algorithm from dynamically triangulated surfaces simulations to CG molecular dynamics simulations or
to take electron microscopy tomography data and build structures for molecular dynamics simulations.

## State

**NOTE**: this version is under development and might be associated with errors and bugs.
Please use the previous version if you are not in direct contact with the developers.
Previous version can be found
[here](#https://github.com/marrink-lab/TS2CG1.1).

## Installation

### Prerequisites

TS2CG is implemented in C++ and includes three separate scripts. *Pointillism* (PLM) and *Membrane
Builder* (PCG) and *Solvate* (SOL).

The minimum installation requirements are:
- Up-to-date *C++ compilers*.
- *Python* 3.6 or later.
- *CMake* version 3.10 or later.

TS2CG builds with the CMake build system, requiring at least version 3.10. You can check whether
CMake is installed, and what version it is, with

```console
cmake --version
```

If you need to install CMake, then first check whether your platform’s package management system
provides a suitable version, or visit the [CMake installation](https://cmake.org/resources/) page
for pre-compiled binaries, source code and installation instructions.

### Install _TS2CG_
#### From PyPi
```console
pip3 install TS2CG
```
#### Directly from GitHub
```console
pip3 install git+https://github.com/weria-pezeshkian/TS2CG-v2.0
```
#### From source
```console
git clone https://github.com/weria-pezeshkian/TS2CG-v2.0
cd TS2CG-v2.0
python3 -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate # Not required, but often convenient.
pip3 install .
```

## Usage
For help on TS2CG and it's executables run:

```console
TS2CG -h
TS2CG {SOL,PLM,PCG} -h
```

## Pointillism (PLM)
Pointillism (PLM), reads a triangulated surface input file e.g., typical outputs of dynamically triangulated surfaces simulations, and generates two sets of points that represent a two smooth surfaces (upper and lower monolayers of a bilayer). It extends the TS file based on the given rescaling factor and an approximated area per lipid.

### Input and output files
The PLM executable requires a triangulated surface file as input.

A triangulated surface file that can be read by this script should be one of the following files:
- `.tsi` [(see .tsi file)](#tsi-file)
- `.q` [(see .q file)](#q-file)
- `.dat` [(see .dat file)](#dat-file)

Output files will be separated into two folders.
- A folder containing a few visualization files.
- A folder that can be read by CG Membrane Builder script [(see below)](#command-line-options-1).
- <!-- Default folder names ??-->

| `-r`                | string      | PLM             | Function (PLM/in_out/check/add_pbc).                                                        |
| `-smooth`           | ------      | no              | Might be necessary for rough surfaces.                                                      |

### Notes
- The approximated area per lipid does not need to be precise, it will be modified during the later processes. 
- The number of the output points is always larger or equal the number of the vertices in the input triangulated surface. With option `-Mashno`  you can tune how many points you want (No_of_vertex*4^Mashno).
- There is no guarantee to get proper surface if rx, ry, rz are not equal.
- Use Mashno [1-4], unless you know what you are doing. 


### Usage example
```console
TS2CG PLM -TSfile Traj1.tsi -bilayerThickness 4 -rescalefactor 3 3 3 -o output
```
## Membrane Builder (PCG)

Membrane builder generates a Gromacs based topology and coordinate file using the [Pointilism](#pointillism) output files. If the system contains protein, or if the user wants to add proteins, a Gromacs coordinate file ([.gro file](#gro-file)) of the protein structure needs be provided. By default, Martini forcefield lipids will be used. Read more about the Martini forcefield on the [Martini website](https://cgmartini.nl/). To backmap to a CG forcefield a lipid structure library needs be provided.

### Input and output files
The PCG executable requires an input file with an .str extension (see[ input.str ](#inputstr-file)file).

There are 3 output files generated by PCG:
- A PCG.log file containing information about the PCG execution.
- A .gro file containing the coordinates of the generated system (see [gro file](#gro-file)).
- A .top file describing the composition of the generated system (see [top file](#top-file)).

### Notes
- With option  `-Bondlength`, you can chnage the initial bond guess. Large Bondlength may generate an unstable structure.
- With  option `-renorm`  the molar ratio of the lipid will be renormalized.
- To get higher denisty, you may increase `-Mashno`  value or reduce <!-- DOES _AP EXISTS? CAN FIND IT --> -ap value in PLM command.
<!--
IS THIS AlSO TRUE?
- For a flat bilayer use -shape flat option in the command line (for this, no TS file is required).
-->
### Usage example
```console
TS2CG PCG -dts point -str input.str -seed 39234  -Bondlength 0.15 
```

## Point class
The Point class is the core of TS2CG regarding the Python scripts. While
[PCG](#membrane-builder-pcg), [PLM](#pointillism) and [SOL](#solvate) are the original scripts that generate the system, the second version includes python tools for more accurate domain manipulation and visualizations. The documentation of these python modules and the point class can be found here:<br>
[Documentation](docs/_build/html/index.html)

## Solvation (SOL)
The Solvation executable solvates the system and provides an option to add ions. 

For information on the script run:
```console
TS2CG SOL -h
```

### Input and output files
The SOL executable requires an input file with a .gro extension (see[ gro ](#gro-file)file). The default option is  `input.gro`.

There are 3 output files generated by SOL:
- An info.txt file containing the amount of atoms added to the system.<br>These lines should be added to the topology file of the system.
- A .gro file containing the coordinates of the solvated system (see [gro file](#gro-file)).
- <!--ONE MORE?MAYBE?-->

## tsi file
The *.tsi files, are DTS simulation trajectory outputs. It contains information about vertices, triangles and inclusion positions.<br> It can be used as input to the [PCG](#membrane-builder-pcg) executable and it is formated as shown below:
#### General Structure

1. Each `.tsi` file begins with a line specifying **version 1.1**.
2. The next line defines the **box size** (`x`, `y`, and `z`) of the system in **nm**.
3. The subsequent three sections describe the **TS mesh**. Each section starts with a keyword (`vertex`, `triangle`, or `inclusion`) and their respective counts.

#### **Vertex section**
- The file includes **1840 vertices**.
- Each vertex is assigned:
  - An **index**.
  - A **position** in `x`, `y`, and `z`.
  - An integer representing the **type**.
#### **Triangles**
- The 1840 vertices are connected via **3680 triangles**.
- Each triangle is defined by:
  - An **index**.
  - The **vertices** it connects.
  - An integer representing the **type**.
- Example:
  - Triangle `0` connects vertices `75`, `776`, and `1043`.
#### **Inclusions**
- A `.tsi` file may include a section for **(protein) inclusions**.
- In this example:
  - There are **three inclusions** of **two different types**.
- Each inclusion is defined by:
  1. An **index**.
  2. The **inclusion type** (e.g., type `1` for inclusions `0` and `1`, type `2` for inclusion `2`).
  3. The **corresponding vertex index**.
  4. **Two floating-point numbers**:
     - These describe a unit two-dimensional vector.
     - The numbers sum to **1**.
     - They define the **orientation** of the inclusion relative to the bilayer normal.

- #include “amber99.ff/forcefield.itp” : this includes the information for the force field you are using, including bonded and non-bonded parameters. 
- [ moleculetype ] : defines the name of your molecule in this top and nrexcl = 3 stands for excluding non-bonded interactions between atoms that are no further than 3 bonds away.
- [ atoms ] : defines the molecule, where nr and type are fixed, the rest is user defined. So atom can be named as you like, cgnr made larger or smaller (if possible, the total charge of a charge group should be zero), and charges can be changed here too.
- [ bonds ] : The pairs of bonds between the atoms of the molecule.
- [ dihedrals ] : in this case there are 9 proper dihedrals (funct = 1), 3 improper (funct = 4) and no Ryckaert-Bellemans type dihedrals. 
- [ position_restraints ] : harmonically restrain the selected particles to reference positions (Position restraints).
- [ dihedral_restraints ] : restrain selected dihedrals to a reference value.
- #include “tip3p.itp” : includes a topology file that was already constructed
- [ system ] : title of your system, user-defined
- [ molecules ] : this defines the total number of (sub)molecules in your system that are defined in this top.
