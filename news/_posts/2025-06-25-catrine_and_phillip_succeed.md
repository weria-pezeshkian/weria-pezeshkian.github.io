Catrine's work was titled "Spontaneous Membrane Repair at the Molecular Scale".

Filip worked in collaboration with T&W Engineering. His project was titled "Implementing TS-TCC for Clinical EEG Epilepsy Detection: Reproduction and Comparison with Traditional Machine Learning Models".

We wish both of them the best for the next step in their journey.
