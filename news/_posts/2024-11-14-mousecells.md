<b>Abstract: </b>
The topographic complexity of the mouse retina has long been underestimated. However, functional gradients exist, which reflect the non-uniform statistics of the visual environment. Horizontal cells are the first visual interneurons that shape the receptive fields of down-stream neurons. We asked whether regional specializations are present in terms of horizontal cell density distributions, morphological properties, localization of gap junction proteins, and the spatial extent of electrical coupling. These key features were asymmetrically organized along the dorsoventral axis. Dorsal cells were less densely distributed, had larger dendritic trees, and electrical coupling was more extensive than in ventral cells. The steepest change occurred at the visual horizon. Our results show that the cellular and synaptic organization of the mouse visual system are adapted to the visual environment at the earliest possible level and that horizontal cells are suited to form the substrate for the global gradient of ganglion cell receptive fields.
