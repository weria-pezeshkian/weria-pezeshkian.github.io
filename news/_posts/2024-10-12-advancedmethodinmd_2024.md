## Advances in Molecular Modeling 2024

Excerpt from LinkedIn:

Earlier this week our group hosted a workshop here at the Niels Bohr Institute. It was two great days filled with socializing, good food and ,of course, science. 
 
Big thanks to Niels Bohr International Academy, Weria Pezeshkian and Anna Duncan for organizing and also all the speakers, in particular the keynote speakers Siewert Jan Marrink, Kresten Lindorff-Larsen, Cecilia Clementi, Paulo Cesar Telles de Souza, Edina Rosta, Dmitry Fedosov, Franca Fraternali.
