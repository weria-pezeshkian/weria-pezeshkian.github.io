## International Membrane Biophysics Meeting "From Model to Cellular Membranes"

Adrià, Neda, and Fabian joined the three day workshop in Drübeck, Germany. Each of them presented a poster with titles:

* Influence of membrane-mediated interactions on protein-induced membrane shape remodeling and fluctuations
* Novel DNA-based force sensor to measure membrane-mediated forces between proteins
* Experimental data informs computational protein cluster prediction in Mitochondria
