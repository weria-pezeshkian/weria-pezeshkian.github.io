# NBI Biocomputing Group
### *bridging the gap between simple models and complex reality*

At NBI Biocomputing Group, our research delves into a wide spectrum of biological processes, ranging from individual molecules to an entire cell. Our main focus is to develop multiscale computer simulation schemes, often referred to as a computational microscope, to bridge the gap between simple models and complex reality and provide mechanistic insight into cellular processes. Our approach is bottom-up, wherein we connect molecular-level interactions to emergent behaviors on a larger scale. This provides experimentally trackable predictions at the macroscopic level. Our endeavors have received financial support from the Novo Nordisk Foundation and Independent Research Fund Denmark.
